# Diabetes Risk Prediction with Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict diabetes risk based on patient health metrics. It compares various approaches including:

- ✅ Full-feature models (using all available health data)
- 🧪 Limited-feature models (using only HbA1c and glucose)
- 🔁 SMOTE-enhanced models (to address class imbalance)

The goal is to optimize classification accuracy and improve recall for identifying positive diabetes cases.

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 Multiple ML models including logistic regression and decision trees
- ⚖️ SMOTE sampling to boost performance on minority class
- 📊 Evaluation via confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve
- 🔍 Feature selection and comparison across models
- 📈 Visualizations to highlight model effectiveness
